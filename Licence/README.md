# README

Courses followed during my Bachelor degree in CMI Mechanics at Sorbonne University. This repository contains my personal work : reports, oral presentation, etc; together with documents from Sorbonne universitiy : exams, courses, etc.

The biggest part of the documents here are from Sorbonne University and so one must make sure to mention them for the use of any documents in here, in addition to a potential secondary author depending on what document you use (e.g. Valentin Duvivier, some preofessor).

Note : most pdf files are compressed so maybe it may cause issues with matlab post-porcess of some of these files.
