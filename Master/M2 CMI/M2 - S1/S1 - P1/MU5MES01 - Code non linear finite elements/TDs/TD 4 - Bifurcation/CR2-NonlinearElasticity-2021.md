# Nonlinear design of concrete bridge towers

The largest bridges in the world are [cable-stayed
bridges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable-stayed_bridge) and [suspension
bridges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_bridge), with spans that are
greater than 1000m. In both cases, the traffic loads and the deck self-weight
are transferred to the foundations through towers (or towers) that are slender
structures, mainly subjected to compression. The figure below displays the
Millau cable-stayed bridge (credits: Nicolas Janberg, via
[Structurae](https://structurae.net/fr/medias/283009-viaduc-de-millau)).

Owing to their slenderness, these structures are subjected to so-called
*second-order effects*, which might lead to their ruin, just like compressing a
spaghetti might lead to its rupture. The goal of this project is to better
understand the role of the second-order effects.

Note that a simplified version of the considerations presented here is implemented
in e.g. [Eurocode 3](https://www.eurocodes.fr/fr/eurocode3.html)
(see EN 1993-1-1, Sec. 6.3). These calculations are routinely implemented in
engineering practices for the design of slender structural members.

We consider a simplified situation, where the tower is subjected to its own
weight only. In the remainder of this assignment, `x` denotes the direction of
gravity, `y` is the in-plane direction perpendicular to `x` and `z` is the
out-of-plane direction.

The tower will be modelled as a hyperelastic, rectangular beam (length: `Lx`,
cross-section: `Ly × Lz`), clamped at one end and subjected to its own weight.

## Part 1. Introduction

The two questions below are based on strength considerations only. Stability
issues and second-order effects will be ignored. In other words, it will be
assumed that the deflection of the tower under its own weight is negligible (the
tower remains straight in its current configuration), see figure below.

**Question 1.1:** What is the maximum length `Lx` of a tower made of concrete
(density: `ρ = 2500 kg/m³`; compressive strength: `fc = 45 MPa`; acceleration of gravity `g = 9.8 (SI)`)? Does that seem realistic to you? 



220 m ?? Given some bridge have a span of 1000m, it looks reliable in terms of magnitude.



In reality, the geometry of the built structure is never perfect. In particular,
we assume here that the tower, although perfectly straight, makes a small angle
`α` with the direction of gravity. (We use `α`=0.0045 radians).

**Question 1.2:** Lack of verticality may introduce some tension in the
structure, and as concrete cannot sustain any tension, this will introduce
another limit in the length `Lx`.

Show that the maximum length `Lx` of a tower is in fact smaller than the value
obtained before. To do so, apply elementary (linear) beam theory, observing that
the structure is statically determinate.

a. Compute the axial force and bending moment at any point of the tower.

b. Compute the normal stress at any point of the tower.

c. Show on a sketch of the tower where the maximum compressive stress and maximum tensile
   stress occur.

d. Write two inequalities expressing the fact that the maximum compressive stress cannot exceed `fc`, and that the maximum tensile stress cannot be above 0.

e. Draw a graph in the plane `(Lx, Ly)` and show the two limiting curves, as well as the secure zone.

f. For a tower with `Ly = 10m`, what is the maximum height `Lx`? What is the limiting cause in this case?

g. For a tower with `Ly = 20m`, what is the maximum height `Lx`? What is the limiting cause in this case?

h. What should be the value of `Lz`?

![Second-order effects](second-order_effects.png)

## Second-order effects

The computations so far have not taken into account the deformation of the tower
under the applied load. We will now take them into account and see that it lowers
dramatically the limiting values computed so far.

The second-order effects will be estimated numerically by means of a 2D (plane
stress) simulation using FEniCS. We consider the same beam as in the tutorial
`HyperelasticSolid.ipynb`. **Be careful with the orientation of gravity!**

For the simulations, we will use the following numerical values

- beam length: `Lx = 1.0m`,
- Young modulus: `E = 1100Pa`,
- Poisson ratio: `ν = 0.35`.

We will test different values of the beam depth `Ly`, starting with `Ly = 0.1 * Lx`.

We define the following non-dimensional ratio

```
       ρ⋅g⋅Lx³
Γ = 12 ───────
        E⋅Ly²
```

When `α = 0` (tower perfectly aligned with gravity), the straight configuration
becomes unstable when `Γ > 7.8`.

Above this critical value, the stable equilibrium configuration is deflected in
the `(x, y)` plane (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-buckling)).

Detecting this loss of stability requires the analysis of the eigenvalues of the
tangent stiffness matrix. A simpler approach is to introduce a geometric
imperfection that will trigger the instability and force the system to adopt its
buckled shape. We will use the angle `α` as an imperfection parameter to study
this buckling problem.

For Part 2, we suggest the following parametrization of the loading

```python
Gamma = 7.84
rho_g = Gamma * Y * Ly**2 / 12 / Lx**3
b0 = dolfin.Expression(("-t * rho_g * cos(alpha)", "t * rho_g * sin(alpha)"),
                       t=0, alpha=alpha, rho_g=rho_g, degree=0)
```

**Question 1.3:** what is the meaning of `t` ?


## Part 2. Nonlinear quasi-static response analysis

The goal of this part is to reproduce a bifurcation diagram similar to the one
in the figure below where we report the transverse-end displacement `u_L / Lx`
as a function of the loading-parameter `t`

![schema](./equilibrium_curve.png)

**Question 2.1:** Set `Ly = 0.1 * Lx`, `α = 0.1` and plot the normalized deflection
`u_L / Lx` at the free end as a function of `t`, for `0 ≤ t ≤ 2`. Interpret the
results.

**Question 2.2:** Discuss the influence of the imperfection `α` on the diagram:
for example how the bifurcation curve is affected by `α`.

**Question 2.3:** Explicitly present the algorithm you used (mesh, time-stepping and
Newton solver), and justify the value of parameters you used to perform the
simulation (load-step, minimum and maximum loads, numerical tolerances, initial
guesses, imperfection…).
The stability limit of the fundamental branch coincides with the first buckling load. Why? Are you able to prove it?



## Part 3. (Nonlinear) Bridge design

We now use parameters value for concrete `g = 9.8 (SI)`, `E = 37GPa`, `α =
0.0045rad`, density `ρ = 2500kg/m³`, Poisson ratio: `ν = 0.35`, and compressive strength `fc = 45MPa`.

**Question 3.1:** For a tower with base `Ly = 10m`, what is the height `Lx`
for which we reach `Γ = 7.8`?

**Question 3.2:** For a tower with base `Ly = 10m`, what is the maximum height
`Lx`?  Is this limitation due to tension or compression? Compare to the value
found in Part 1. Comment.

**Question 3.3:** For a tower with base `Ly = 20m`, what is the height `Lx`
for which we reach `Γ = 7.8`?

**Question 3.4:** For a tower with base `Ly = 20m`, what is the height `Lx`
for which the limitation is due to tension? Due to compression? Compare to the
value found in Part 1. Comment.

**Question 3.5:** Same questions with `Ly = 35m`.

**Question 3.6:** In the plane (`Lx`,`Ly`), draw the safe zone (carefully choose the scale on the axes and find several points for the border of the safe zone, compare with what was found in Part 1.)


## Part 10. Only if you dont take vacations

We note `P_i` the different bifurcation points.

Here we use

- beam length: `Lx = 1.0m`, `Ly = 0.1m`
- Young modulus: `E = 1100Pa`,
- Poisson ratio: `ν = 0.35`.

**Question 10.1:** Find the second bifurcation point `P_2`, for example in the
following way. Go through `P_1` by setting `α = 0`, then use a small value of
`α` to hit the second bifurcation point `P_2`.

**Question 10.2** Is it true that for `Ly > 0.3` only `P_1` and `P_2` remain?

**Question 10.3** Is it true that for `Ly > 0.9` there is no longer any bifurcation point?

## Part 20. A bit further: Stability analysis

By studying the sign of the smallest eigenvalue of the hessian matrix, study the stability of the three branches in the bifurcation diagram given in part I. Produce a figure where each branch is coloured in red if unstable and in green if stable. The stability limit of the fundamental branch coincides with the first buckling load. Why? Are you able to prove it?

For the stability analysis, you can use the notebook `NonlinearStabilityCheck.ipynb` as an example.

Further documentation:
  - Some details on the linearization of the equilibrium equations and the derivatives can be found in Section 3.5 of [2]
  - You can look also to [3] for the buckling analysis.
