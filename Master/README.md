# README
Courses followed during my Master degree of Computational Mechanics (+ CMI Mechanics) at Sorbonne University. This repository contains my personal work : reports, oral presentation, etc; together with documents from Sorbonne/ENSAM/ENPC/Polytechnique universities : exams, courses, etc.

The biggest part of the documents here are from Sorbonne University and so one must make sure to mention them for the use of any documents in here, in addition to a potential secondary author depending on what document you use (e.g. Valentin Duvivier, some professor, some school).
