# README

Courses followed during my Bachelor and Master (CompMech) cursus in CMI Mechanics at Sorbonne University. This repository contains my personal work : reports, oral presentation, etc; together with documents from Sorbonne/ENSAM/ENPC/Polytechnique universities : exams, courses, etc.

The biggest part of the documents here are from Sorbonne University and so one must make sure to mention them for the use of any documents in here, in addition to a potential secondary author depending on what document you use (e.g. Valentin Duvivier, some professor, some school).

I have some softwares with complete installation process available (e.g. Abaqus, Catia, Office 2019). If you are interested, you can contact me to vltn04@gmail.com so I share these files with you if you need it.
